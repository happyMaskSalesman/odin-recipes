        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Macaroni: </strong>(8 ounces) This homemade mac and cheese starts with a box of uncooked macaroni noodles</li>
            <li><strong>Butter </strong>and <strong>flour: </strong>(3 tablespoons flour) You'll need butter and flour to make a roux for the cheese sauce. You'll also need two tablespoons of butter for the topping.</li>
            <li><strong>Milk: </strong>(2 1/2 cups) Use whole milk for the richest flavor and texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese: </strong>(2 cups shredded Cheddar, 1/2 cup grated Parmesan) This baked mac and cheese recipe calls for Cheddar and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings: </strong>(to taste) Salt and pepper goes into the sauce, while paprika is sprinkled over the topping.</li>
            <li><strong>Bread crumbs: </strong>(1/2 cup) Use store-bought dried bread crumbs or make your own at home.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
            <li>Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
            <li>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
